\textbf{Free and Open Source Software in Education} (FOSSEE, http://fossee.in)
provides free support on FOSS (free and open source software) to eliminate the
use of proprietary software packages in Science and Engineering Education
across India. The shift to FOSS packages will help educational institutions
monetarily.

\noindent Following are some important activities of FOSSEE: 

\begin {enumerate}

\item SELF Workshops through which we provide help to conduct FOSS workshops

\item Textbook Companion is a document for FOSS to use in academic institution.
We have more than 200 Textbook companions for most of the Engineering and
Science subjects.

\item Through Lab Migration activity we provide help to academic institutions
to shift their labs based on proprietary software to FOSS. 

\newline Students and faculty involved in Textbook Companion and Lab
Migration are given honorarium for their efforts.

\item FOSSEE team conducts International and National conferences.

\end {enumerate}

We promote the following FOSS 

\begin{itemize}

\item Scilab to replace Matlab
 
\item Python, a scripting language

\item Oscad to replace OrCad

\item OpenFoam, a FOSS alternative to FLUENT

\item COIN-OR for optimization

\end{itemize}

These endeavours are successfully moving forward through the participation of
students and faculty of colleges and universities all over India.
